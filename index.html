              science.

            resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate
            on Earth.

            <h3>1953</h3>
            - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
            American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It
            goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1962</h3>
            - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the

            <h3>2005</h3>
            - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues
            that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
            as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
            dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
            for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
            the best breeds."
