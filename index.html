        Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on
        how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.

        <h3>1953</h3>
        - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling

        goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

        that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
        as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
        dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
        for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
        the best breeds."
